# Simon-Game
This repository includes Simon-Game project implemented by HTML,CSS &amp; JavaScript (JQuery).

 A re-creation of the classic Simon memory game. The objective of the game is to produce a 
 random sequence of colors, which becomes increasingly longer and complex
 making it harder to remember with each increasing level.
